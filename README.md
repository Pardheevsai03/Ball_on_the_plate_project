# Ball_on_the_plate_project
This Project is basically to balance the ball on the plane using servo motors.
Test 05 is the python open cv code used for identification of the position of the ball.
Arduino code is the code for servo motors to control the angle of the plate.
In the above arduino Pid control the kp ki kd values may vary depending upon the palcing of servo motors.
